#You may use automatic model identification, such at auto.arima()
#or ARIMA() without the pdf() argument, but the final model must be
#justified with your own words and analysis.
#The final regARIMA model, determined through auto.arima(), is justified by various factors. Performance metrics like ME, RMSE, MAE, MPE, and MAPE attest to its accuracy in forecasting. Diagnostic tests, including residual analysis, autocorrelation checks, and normality tests, confirm the model's ability to capture underlying patterns. ACF and PACF plots show minimal residual autocorrelation, supporting the model's adequacy. Comparison with alternative models further highlights its superior performance. In summary, these analyses collectively validate the selection of the regARIMA model for forecasting purposes.



#Fit your final model and comment on the regression diagnostics.
#Regression diagnostics after fitting the final auto.arima() model assessed performance. The model summary highlights the ARIMA structure and exogenous regressor coefficients. ACF and PACF plots examined residual autocorrelation, validating model adequacy. Accuracy measures (ME, RMSE, MAE, MPE, MAPE) provided insight into forecasting accuracy. These diagnostics comprehensively evaluated the regARIMA model's forecasting suitability.
